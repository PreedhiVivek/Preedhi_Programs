    <img src="D://Preedhi_Vivek/Downloads/Pree_ProfilePic.jpg"></img>

    <p> I am a Software Tester by profession. I did my Masters in Software Engineering and worked for ANZ for 6+ years.</p>
    <p> I love to read, sing and listen to music. Melodies are my favourite genre. I am a trained carnatic music singer. </p>
    <p> I love my country and am patriotic. I keep myself abreast with the current affairs.</p>
    <p> I have a deep love for animals and was blessed to have my bro-dog Goofy for a decade with me.</p>
